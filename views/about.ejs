              Become a legendary Viking warrior raised on tales of battle and
              glory. Raid your enemies, grow your settlement and build your
              political power in the quest to earn a place among the gods in
              Valhalla. Advanced RPG mechanics allow you to shape the growth of
              your character and influence the world around you. With every
              choice you make, from political alliances and combat strategy to
              dialogue and gear progression, you will carve your own path to
              glory. Construct and upgrade buildings that allow for deep
              customization, including a barracks, blacksmith, tattoo parlour
              and more. Recruit new members to your clan and personalise your
              Viking experience.
